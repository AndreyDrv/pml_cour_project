peer 2 → "Train (128), Test (50), Validation (39) datasets are splitted as 60% x 20% x 20%" I am not completely sure what 128, 50 and 39 are supposed to be. They cannot be 128 observations only, maybe 128000? Although the (128 + 50 + 39)*1000 goes over the number of observations in the training dataset. You should make this clearer. Also, I am not quite sure that test (50) and validation (39) are correct, if both are 20% of the data, shouldn't they be equal?
peer 3 → I gave you max points. Job well done. I am only surprised you got an accuracy of 97% on random forest, while my random forest fit scored 99,5%. I think this is due to PCA. To improve performance of random Forest you could try to drop the formula interface of Random Forest (that makes it slow) and explicitly state the features and predictors, such as randomForest(trainingCleanNAnzv[,c(2,7:58)],trainingCleanNAnzv[,59],ntree=35,do.trace=TRUE)
